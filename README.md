# üí∞ React Treasure Hunt Game

### ü§î Remember
- Pseudocode!!
- Ask clarifying questions

### üìö User Stories
- As a user, I can see a page with a 3 by 3 grid board game with a question mark in each square.
* Branch: grid
* Added an empty div to Square.js component
    * Styled in CSS to have a height, width, border imported and called component in App.js
* Mapped over board array in state to display Square component for each iteration 
* Added styling on a div that surronds our mapped squares 
    * Used flex and wrapk along with setting width. 
    * Centered both gamboard and header
* Passed the value of board to our square component to show question mark.
* Styled question mark to be larger and centered 
* (DONE)

- As a user, when I click on one of the question marks an alert appears with the index position of that question mark in the array.
    * Branch: alert-index
    * Passed index into square component 
    * Made an onClick method that alerts user to what index of the box. 
        *Paased the method down to Square to be invoke when onClikc is clicked. 
    * (DONE)

- As a user, when I click on one of the question marks instead of the alert the question mark turns into a tree emoji.
    * Branch: tree-emoji
    * Destructured board from state so that we could update a sing instance to be a tree emoji when clicked
    * Set state once updated 
    * (DONE)

- As a user, if I select the winning square the question mark will become a treasure emoji and if I select the losing square the question mark will become a bomb emoji.
* Branch: treasure-bomb
* Setup componentDidMount to randomize a treasure location and set to state
* Checked if index is treasureLocation in handleGamePlay 
    * If so, emoji is updated to treasure
    * Else, emoji is set to a tree
* Repeated process to account for bomblocation
- As a user, I can click on a ‚ÄúPlay Again‚Äù button that will restart the game.

- As a user, I can see a counter that shows how many guesses I have left. The counter starts at 5 and decrements one every time I click on a square that is not the treasure nor the bomb.
- As a user, I can see a message informing me that I won the game if I select the square that contains the treasure.
- As a user, I can see a message informing me that I lost the game if I select the square that contains the bomb.
- As a user, I cannot continue to play the game after I win or lose.
- As a user, I can see a message informing me that I lost the game when I run out of turns (the counter reaches zero).


### üèî Stretch Goals
- Consider how to handle a situation where the bomb and the treasure are at the same index.
